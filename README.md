The worst unholy combination of old school text adventure games and visual novel engines, very WIP

---

This project is not really intended as a public thing and support/development will be on a best-effort basis.

But, this is a very simple and primitive engine with scripting format for making text-style games.
The eventual goal is to have something like kirikiri where the implementation of the language used to script in is very open, but with lesser abstraction and a straight view into the engine for english speakers (no amount of code readability will solve an inability to read comments.)

This project is also intended as a way for me to properly learn rust so the code might not be the best, but I have written hackier scripts in my life that only worked with god's blessing (I should write an operating system to help accomodate his stay on here in my own language called holy-rust).
